# File Handling Exercises for Final Project

## 1. Automating Data Entry

### Scenario:
Build a system that allows drivers to log trips and remittances digitally via a simple web app or mobile-friendly dashboard.

### Exercise:
- Create a Python script that reads driver trip data from a text file and stores it in a structured format using Pandas.
- Write a function to append new trip data to the file whenever a driver logs a trip.

#### Tasks:
1. Read trip data from 'trips.txt' and load it into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Define a function `log_trip(driver_id, distance, remittance)` that appends a new trip entry to 'trips.txt'.
3. Ensure the function updates the DataFrame with the new trip data.

## 2. Data Analysis & Reporting

### Scenario:
Track daily, weekly, and monthly remittances.

### Exercise:
- Use data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate insights on payment trends.

#### Tasks:
1. Read remittance data from 'remittances.csv' into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Calculate total remittances for daily, weekly, and monthly periods.
3. Use Matplotlib to plot a line graph showing remittance trends over time.
4. Use Seaborn to create a bar chart comparing weekly remittances.

These exercises will help you practice file handling and data analysis, preparing you for the final project where you'll automate data entry and generate insightful reports.
